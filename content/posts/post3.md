Hello Alexya !

I’m very excited to write to you too! I love the parts you add. I don’t have a printer, but I will do my best to illustrate it. A little bit about me. I’m 22 years old. I don’t travel much farthest I got was Colorado. I also have been to South Dakota and North Dakota (though for me that’s hours away). I graduated highschool (secondary school) 4 years ago. A year later, I went to college for vet tech. But since I failed one class for my horrible spelling, they wanted me to restart the whole year. So instead, I decided to just settle in with life. Couple months later my boyfriend of 6 years proposed to me. We are planning to get married on Oct 10th. I have 4 chickens : Turken, Deliha (even though he’s a rooster), Mary-Kate and Ashley. I also have 8 chicks : Dolly, Dixie, Cluckraptor , Johny Bravo, Chance, Greg, Mrs. Frizzle and one unnamed right now. I live in a countryside, but I will be living with my fiance soon. My daily life is so boring. I used to work for a screen print, but with all this going on I have been forgotten. I’m hopping to work soon. I kind of miss it. For now, I live with my parents and sisters. I feel good just anxious about planning the wedding. I still need to send out my invitations. Well, I better let you go. Stay safe and write soon!
