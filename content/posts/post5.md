# Dear Alexya, 
Greetings from Brisbane, Australia. I hope you are well and staying safe. I’m so excited to be writing you and helping you with your English. I love being able to connect with new people around the world and hopefully I am able to make some friends. I will start by saying my name is Alanna and I am 23 years old. I lived in Brisbane my whole life and as much as I love it, I really want to move overseas. I love travel and have always been interested from a young age. I have been dreaming of France most of my life but really want to see the world. I’m sure there is so much more exciting things about me, but we can find out more about each other in future letters. Feel free to ask anything. I’d love to know more about you and your beautiful country. I can’t wait to share more about my beautiful country. I included a postcard[^1] to show you a few of my favourite places but there is so much more to see and do. Have you been to Australia? Is there anything you would like to know about Australia? I’m not sure what else to say, sorry. This is my first time and I’m not sure how to start off the first letter. But I’ll leave it there for now and I really can’t wait to hear from you.

## Carte postale

[^1]: Voici le message à l’endos de la carte postale : « I hope you like this card. I made it myself with photos I have taken around my home city (Brisbone) from frequent visits to the gold coast and a short trip to Sydney a few years ago. »
