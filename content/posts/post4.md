Hi Alexya!

Sorry for the long delay on the letter. I was very determined to finish a drawing. It was Alastor from Hazbin Hotel. I’m usually bad at drawing people so took me a bit. That’s cool that you liked Avatar: The Last Airbender. I watched most of them but not all of them. I do have an Appa plushie though I got from Mall of America. We actually decided to move our wedding well at least ceremony wise. When we found a home, we plan to get legally married. Six years has been long for us and we want to be together. This is why we will have our ceremony later in the spring. Glad that you like "Weird Al" Yankovic. I like him since middle school. I like that Pokemon have different region names. What is it for Torchic? I prefer cats but I mostly like chickens. They usually care for themselves. I just let them roam around and feed them corn in the morning and evening just don’t get a lot of roosters my hens hate it (lol). I guess it be hard in the winter because I have to make sure they stay warm, have water and food and don’t get bored and dick. I usually buy them a feed block and hang up lettuce so they have something. As for my life so far has been good. I got a part time job at an old pizza place I use to work at. I’m going to work there till my other job calls me back. Well, I better let you go. Stay safe and write soon!

P.S. Thank you for the earrings! I will wear them in the front with sparkly sparkle buck studs. 

P.P.S. (next day) Cluckraptor passed away. A dog came to kill her and dislocated another chicken leg.
