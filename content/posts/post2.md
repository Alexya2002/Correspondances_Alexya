Dear Alexya, 
How are you? I hope you are well. My name is Maggie and I’m from Australia. Currently I live in Sydney but I’m originally from Sunny Queensland which is up North. I moved to Sydney for uni and work since there are a lot more opportunities than in Queensland career wise. At the moment I am studying cyber security at Macquarie University as an external student but during the day I work in Anance. I’m definitely a busy bee but as I’m getting older I’m trying to slow down a bit instead of living life on autopilot. I’m trying to engage with my favourite hobbies such as photography, calligraphy (just new to fountain pens) and writing. I wanted to share with you two of my favourite photographs: one of Coogee Beach and one of the Boy Run in Drummoyne. I open a lot of my time in these two places last year and they both have a very special place in my heart. Have you ever been to Australia? If you ever come to Sydney please let me know I’d love to take you there! I haven’t really travelled much and had some plans this year… I guess they will have to wait! What are some of your hobbies and favourite places? Are you a student or working or both? Looking forward to getting to know you. Take care!
