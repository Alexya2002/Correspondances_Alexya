Dear Alexya,

Thank you for agreeing to be my pen pal. I can’t wait to get to know you. I should probably introduce myself. As you know my name is Emma, I’m 21 and I’m from Scotland. I currently still live with my parents, but I hope to be moving in with my boyfriend soon. I also have two older brothers, but they have both moved out. However, we are still very close. Do you have a partner or any siblings? Do you study or work or anything? I started my own business two and a bit years ago. I do makeup for photoshoots, tv and film productions. I love my job and I love to be creative. I just hope this lockdown ends soon because I can’t wait to get back to work. What are some of you interests? I love art, music, crafting, nature, writing, makeup, movies, food, true crime shows, culture and travelling. Have you visited any countries?  Where has been your favourite place to visit? My favourite country to visit has been Germany. I loved Berlin for the food, the environment, the people, and the culture. How is life in Quebec? Do you like living in Quebec? Were you born and raised in Quebec? Anyways I’ll leave it there. Hope to hear from you soon. Take care.
